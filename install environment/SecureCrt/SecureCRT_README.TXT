Product Overview
----------------

SecureCRT protects your passwords, user accounts, and data, combining
rock-solid terminal emulation with the strong encryption, broad
authentication options, and data integrity of the Secure Shell (SSH)
protocol.

SecureCRT provides versatile solutions for a wide range of business,
network management, information security, and development tasks, from
accessing host-based applications and administering servers to
securely accessing behind-the-firewall network resources like e-mail,
files, and printers.

SecureCRT supports SSH1, SSH2, Telnet, Telnet/SSL, RLogin, Serial,
and TAPI protocols and authentication via password, public key, X.509
certificate, and Kerberos v5 via GSSAPI.  Ciphers include AES,
Twofish, Blowfish, 3DES, and RC4.

Choose from a wide range of emulations including VT100, VT102, VT220,
ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console -– all with ANSI
color.  Unicode support includes the ability to display character sets
from multiple languages, support for languages with right-to-left
reading order, and a character encoding list that includes
commonly-used encodings as well as all encodings supported by the
local system.

SecureCRT features a multi-session tabbed interface with extensive
session management and customization features.  Customization options
include toolbars, menus, keymaps, button  bar, and login scripts, as
well as fonts, cursors, and color schemes. 

Named sessions and firewalls let you create individual configurations
that can be used on a session-specific basis.  Other features include
the Activator tray utility to minimize desktop clutter, auto logon,
printing, Emacs mode, and SOCKS firewall support.

Powerful scripting capabilities, including ActiveX scripting support
for VBScript and other scripting languages, save you valuable time by
automating routine configuration tasks.  Secure file transfers can be
performed using Zmodem or Xmodem from an SSH1 or SSH2 session. Upload
files easily by dragging and dropping them onto an SFTP tab or session
window.

Save steps with the close integration of SecureCRT and the SecureFX(R)
file transfer client, which share sessions and settings that let you
run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions without
reentering passwords.

SecureCRT includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license for
the fully functional application and access to VanDyke Software(R)
technical support.

1. New For SecureCRT 6.5
------------------------

The major new features for SecureCRT 6.5 are:

  - Tab enhancements

    - New tab display options: Customize how tab status indicators are
      displayed by choosing between icons and tab background colors.
      The tab bar can now be positioned at the bottom of the SecureCRT
      window to customize your work space.

    - Session inactivity notification: New inactivity status
      indicator lets you visually keep track of session activity while
      working in multiple tabs.

  - Time-saving features

    - Real-time keyword highlighting: Highlight keywords in the
      session window to identify errors in log files or streaming
      output and to highlight prompts.

    - Drag-and-drop file transfers: Start an SFTP file transfer
      faster by dragging and dropping files and folders onto the
      SFTP tab.  You can also drag files onto the session tab and
      choose between ASCII, Xmodem, Ymodem, and Zmodem.

    - CTRL+click on URL: Open a URL with a CTRL+click using this
      new option.  When working with scrolling text, this provides
      a faster way to open a URL.

    - Native support for Amazon EC2 keys: Only the private key is
      required for authentication, making it easy to use Amazon EC2
      keys.

  - Updated and improved user interface

    - New display options and themes: An updated look for the user
      interface includes several new display themes.

    - Cleaner, more flexible button bar: Buttons are easier to read
      with automatic sizing to fit the text label.  Only configured
      buttons are displayed, which keeps the button bar neat.

  - Broader Unicode support

    - Unicode support is now enhanced with the ability to display
      character sets from multiple languages, improved support for
      languages with right-to-left reading order, and other
      improvements.  Several commonly used encodings have been added
      to the character encoding list.

  - Scripting enhancements

    - SecureCRT’s powerful scripting capabilities have been expanded
      with new options for use of encrypted passwords and the
      ability to write messages to the status bar.

  - Windows 7 compatibility

    - SecureCRT is compatible with Windows 7, including support for
      the new taskbar.
