Changes in SecureCRT 6.5 (Official) -- December 10, 2009
--------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash if the application's Close button was
    pressed more than once.
  - If a key was mapped to a string that contained "\p" (pause),
    SecureCRT crashed when the key was pressed in the terminal
    window.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.5 (Beta 5) -- December 3, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If a .XML custom menu and toolbar file contained a menu on
    the toolbar, SecureCRT crashed when trying to import it into
    version 6.5.
  - SecureCRT could crash if text was double clicked while session
    output was scrolling and was more likely to occur if the
    scrollback lines were set to 0.
  - If invalid parameters were passed into the script function
    Screen.Get2, SecureCRT crashed.
  - On Windows 7, if the Global.ini option "Disable Aero Peek" was
    enabled and an Auto session was specified, SecureCRT crashed on
    start up.
  - On Windows 7 and Vista, if the option "Only show tabs when
    there are more than one" was set and a session was connected
    and then that session and another were opened in a new window,
    the first session shrunk by two rows.
  - If the global option "Only show tabs when there are more than
    one" was set and a second session was connected, the tab status
    indicator for the first session showed that it was disconnected
    even though it was connected.
  - When "ANSI Color" was off, some of the vttest "double-sized
    characters" tests did not display correctly for VT100 sessions.
  - If the SecureCRT cursor was blinking or there was blinking text
    displayed in the session and a menu was activated, the cursor
    and text stopped blinking.
  - If a column selection was made, after releasing the ALT key,
    focus switched to the menu.
  - If two SecureCRT windows were open in separate processes, if
    the display theme was changed, the toolbar was not always
    updated to the new theme in the other windows.
  - The script function Screen.Get2 only returned the first
    character.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.5 (Beta 4) -- November 11, 2009
------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Added a Global.ini-file-only option to disable the Windows 7
    Aero task bar peek functionality.
  - Added a Global.ini-file-only option to put the close button
    to the right of the tab bar rather than on the active tab.

Bug fixes:

  - If a session was connected to a remote server that was the DNS
    server and the remote server went down, SecureCRT could crash.
  - Fixed a GDI resource leak.
  - Ymodem transfers could fail because SecureCRT did not send and
    honor the file length in the file header packet.
  - If a key was mapped to send a string and that key was pressed in
    the chat window, the first character of the string was not sent.
  - If SecureCRT was not active and the most recently used tab was
    clicked, SecureCRT did not become active.
  - Pressing CTRL+TAB with multiple tabs open did not always switch
    to the most recently used tab.
  - If the display theme was set to Black, Aqua, or Silver, after
    coming out of hibernation, the display theme was changed to Blue.
  - If the tab status indicators used the "Background colors" option,
    the active tab was closed, and it had a different status than the
    newly active tab, then the newly active tab did not have the
    correct background color behind the close tab button.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.5 (Beta 3) -- October 29, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Restored previous behavior of allowing the password to be saved
    regardless of the "Auto Save Options" setting.

Bug fixes:

  - It was possible for SecureCRT to crash when attempting to select
    text near the end of a line.
  - SecureCRT could crash when configuring a private key for a
    session.
  - SecureCRT could crash when a tab was closed if the Session
    Options dialog had been opened after connecting to a session.
  - If the INI-file only option "Force Close On Exit" was set and
    an SSH2 session was connected and cloned, if one of the tabs was
    closed, SecureCRT crashed on exit.
  - Displaying certain Unicode sequences could cause SecureCRT to
    hang.
  - Scrolling Unicode data was much slower than scrolling non-Unicode
    data.
  - The underscore character was included in the list of default
    delimiters.
  - If the user had full write access to the root drive and
    attempted to log to a file in the root drive, an "Access Denied"
    error was reported.
  - Send ASCII ignored the end-of-line characters if the text file
    contained end-of-line characters other than CRLF.
  - Clicking the red "X" in the Windows 7 taskbar peek for SecureCRT
    did not close SecureCRT.
  - On Windows 7, if ANSI color was on and a tab subsequent to the
    first tab was connected, the terminal area in the new tab
    flickered, briefly showing lines of different colors.
  - When the JAWS screen reading software was used in cursor mode,
    if output that contained blank lines was displayed in SecureCRT,
    using the arrow keys to move the mouse cursor over the blank
    lines caused the cursor to jump over several blank lines instead
    of moving one line at a time.
  - After upgrading to 6.5, if a custom menu and toolbar XML file
    from version 6.2 or earlier existed, the ALT+B accelerator to
    connect in a tab no longer worked.
  - If the global option "Show confirm disconnect dialog" was off
    and a session was connected and cloned, then the cloned session
    was closed using the close button on the tab, window decorations
    such as menus and toolbar buttons did not receive focus when
    mousing over them.
  - Output that did not wrap when printed under Windows XP wrapped
    when printed under Windows 7 and Vista.
  - Bold characters were not printed as bold characters.
  - SSH2: Attempting to use a private key without a corresponding
    public key caused SecureCRT 6.5 beta 2 to crash.
  - SFTP: SecureCRT could crash when downloading a directory that
    contained thousands of files.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.5 (Beta 2) -- October 15, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - The chat window can be resized by dragging the splitter bar.

Changes:

  - SSH2: When an RSA key is used for authentication, only the
    private key is required, which makes it easier to use Amazon
    EC2 keys.
  - If a custom menu (.mnu) file specifies the "Office 2007" theme,
    which is not available in SecureCRT 6.5, the "Office 2003" theme
    is put in the menu instead.

Bug fixes:

  - If the Activator was exited while the Global Options dialog was
    open, SecureCRT crashed.
  - SecureCRT crashed if a session that specified a non-existent
    keymap was cloned or opened a second time.
  - If the /NOMENU option was specified on the command line, a
    "Failed to create empty document" error was reported.
  - For Ymodem transfers, 128-byte packets were sent when Ymodem-1k
    option was specified.
  - The Delete, Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys did not work in
    the chat window.
  - If the paste on middle button option was set and a middle button
    press was simulated by pressing the left and right mouse buttons
    together, the context menu was displayed.
  - If the tab bar was not displayed when SecureCRT started and then
    a session was connected and the tab bar was displayed, the status
    indicator icon did not have the correct status.
  - When the status indicators were shown as background colors, if
    there were more tabs than could fit across the window and a tab
    was closed, the tab bar was not redrawn correctly.
  - If the toolbar was changed to a custom toolbar and then back to
    the default toolbar, the "Toolbar Options" drop-down arrow was
    no longer displayed.
  - If a custom menu (.mnu) file was specified and SecureCRT was
    restarted, then the custom menu was cleared and SecureCRT was
    restarted, the toolbar icons were not displayed correctly.
  - It was possible to close a locked session from the Windows 7
    taskbar.
  - If SecureCRT was minimized, the thumbnail in the Windows 7
    taskbar displayed a busy circle until it eventually failed to
    get a thumbnail bitmap and displayed a default icon. 
  - If SecureCRT connected to multiple sessions at start up and then
    was minimized, the Windows 7 taskbar only contained a
    thumbnail image for one of the tabbed sessions.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.5 (Beta 1) -- October 1, 2009
----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Unicode support was improved in the following areas: character
    sets from multiple languages can be viewed in a session, display
    of right-to-left reading order languages, UTF-8 characters can
    be mapped in the Keymap Editor, Send/Receive ASCII works with
    UTF-8 data, UTF-8 filenames can be used in the SFTP tab,
    pass-through printing supports UTF-8 data, and better behavior
    with scripts that use combining marks to compose characters.
  - In the Session Options dialog, the list of character encodings
    displays all the encodings supported by the system.
  - Added an option that allows words to be specified in a list so
    that they can be highlighted as they appear in the session.
  - An inactivity status notification option can be set for tabbed
    sessions so that activity can be monitored in tabbed sessions
    other than the current session.
  - There are new display settings for tab status indicators, which
    are icons and tab background color.
  - The tab bar position can be set to the bottom of the SecureCRT
    window.
  - When a session is locked, a locked icon is displayed on the tab
    unless the "Color rectangles" status indicators are used.
  - SecureCRT has several new Windows display themes.
  - If a file is dragged from MS Explorer or other OLE-enabled
    application into a connected SecureCRT session, it can be
    transferred using ASCII, Xmodem, Ymodem, or Zmodem.
  - Added a global option that allows URLs to be opened by
    CTRL+clicking them.
  - A new session option allows mouse wheel scroll events to be
    sent to the remote application.
  - A new script function GetActiveTab returns the currently active
    tab.
  - Added the ability to wait for a case insensitive string in a
    script.  The functions WaitForString and WaitForStrings take an
    optional parameter to specify that the case should be ignored.
    Additionally, the property IgnoreCase has been added to the Screen
    object so that this can be set globally.
  - Added a script function SetStatusText that allows the status
    bar text to be set from a script.
  - The script functions SetOption and GetOption now allow encrypted
    passwords to be used in a script.
  - A command-line parameter /SESSION_FOLDER allows all the sessions
    in a folder to be connected when SecureCRT starts.
  - A command-line parameter /EncryptedPassword has been added, which
    allows an encrypted password to be specified on the command line.
  - SFTP: Dragging a file from MS Explorer or another OLE-enabled
    application initiates a put command on the file.

Changes:

  - Increased scrolling performance when large amounts of text are
    output to the session.
  - The following changes were made to the button bar: only
    configured buttons are displayed, the button width is determined
    by the button label, and the button bar menu is now on the left
    side of the bar.
  - The "Semaphore timeout" error is now displayed in the session's
    trace output instead of a message box.
  - The maximum value that the global maximum columns option can be
    set to is now 32,000.
  - Modified the script function LogFileName so that if the log
    filename contains parameter substitutions and logging is on,
    the name of the file currently being logged to is returned.
  - Added a "Start Upload" button to the Zmodem Upload List dialog.
  - The character encoding restrictions on the vt100 font have been
    removed.
  - In the Map Selected Key dialog, pressing the Default button
    removes the entry from the keymap file.
  - In the Keymap Editor dialog, pressing ALT+O closes the dialog.
  - The close button now appears on the tab itself instead of to the
    right of the tab bar.
  - Serial: The baud rate is now displayed in the status bar.

Bug fixes:

  - If data being sent using Send ASCII contained a null character,
    nothing after the null character was sent.
  - Zmodem transfers did not complete when attempting to download
    a zero-byte file.
  - The Xterm command "Use Alternate Screen Buffer" did not work.
  - The anti-idle string was not sent when a session was locked.
  - If a session was locked, the double-click tab action was still
    honored.
  - When a session was started from the Activator, the new session
    window appeared behind other application windows.
  - If a session without a username was edited while it was connected,
    the username entered during authentication was saved to the
    session.
  - If multiple sessions were being edited and a port forward was
    added or deleted, only the first session was modified.
  - If one tabbed session was showing the button bar and another
    tabbed session was not, then the second tab was moved to the
    first position and then back and the window was resized, the
    number of columns would increase when the mouse was released.
  - The number of lines specified for the scrollback buffer of the
    first tabbed session was also used for the other tabbed sessions.
  - The "Upon Disconnect" custom log data was written twice to the
    log file.
  - Exiting Activator while a SecureCRT session was locked left a
    SecureCRT process running that could only be accessed through
    the Windows Task Manager.
  - If the configuration folder's path had a trailing backslash,
    sessions could not be connected from the Activator or from
    SecureFX (if it was installed).
  - When %I was specified as a variable in the title bar session
    option, it was not replaced with the IP address.
  - If the color scheme attributes were changed while the "ANSI color"
    and "Use color scheme" options were set, the "Overstrike bold"
    attribute was not changed.
  - SecureCRT had to be restarted for ANSI color table changes to take
    effect.
  - The locked status of a tabbed session was not displayed correctly
    in the status bar until the mouse moved over the toolbar or menu
    bar, or the mouse was clicked in the session window.
  - If a window other than SecureCRT had focus and Connect was
    called from a script, the SecureCRT window could get focus.
  - If the active tabbed session was disconnected, text could not
    be pasted into the chat window.
  - If the installer was run in silent mode and an answer file that
    could not be found was specified on the command line, a dialog
    was displayed.
  - SecureCRT offered to make itself the default Telnet handler even
    when the Telnet protocol DLL was not available.
  - RLogin: Sending window size messages to the server when they had
    not been requested could cause garbage to be displayed in the
    session.
  - Serial, TAPI: Zmodem transfers over Serial or TAPI did not switch
    into and out of binary mode correctly, which could cause the
    transfers to hang or transfer the same file repeatedly.
  - Serial: When a button was mapped to send a string of non-printing
    octal characters, the order of the characters was sometimes
    swapped when they were sent. 
  - SSH1/SSH2: In the Enter SSH Username dialog, if the Save
    username check box was checked and the Auto Save Settings
    option was off, the username was not saved.
  - SSH2: In the Key Generation wizard, if the specified path for the
    key contained two or more folders that did not exist, they key
    could not be saved.
